# rxscan
A basic UWP scanning app designed to alleviate complexity from the default Windows Fax &amp; Scan app for casual users.

NOTE: UWP development is currently on hold - The project has been completely rewritten as a WPF app with many improvements available [here](https://github.com/arxcdr/rxscanwpf).
